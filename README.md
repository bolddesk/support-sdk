# BoldDesk Support SDK

The BoldDesk Mobile Support SDK enables the integration of a fully functional help centre directly within your mobile application.

This allows end-users to access support tickets and knowledge base articles inside the app, reducing the need to open a web browser.

With the SDK, you can:
* Create a customisable help centre dashboard.
* Enable users to submit support requests with attachments.
* Offer search and filtering capabilities for knowledge base articles to support self-service.
* Track ticket status, reply to agents, update, and close tickets.
* Support both anonymous and authenticated users through JWT-based authentication.
* Include push notifications for real-time updates.

The SDK is lightweight, supports theming to match your app's branding, and guarantees secure authentication.
